##App Background:

Thousands of K-12 schools have recently adopted tablet technology to better accommodate student learning. Teachers who already have set curriculum often rely on paper assignments, and need a way to transfer their documents to a digital platform that is accessible to their students. Klassewerk provides a way for teachers to upload and modify existing worksheets, and immediately share them with their students via a web interface. Once a student completes a worksheet, teachers are able to view their responses and provide instant feedback.

##Features:

**Sign up:** (*Should be as simple as possible for students.*)
- Students sign up with a class code, full name, and username.
- Teachers sign up with their full name and email.
  
**Views:**
- Teachers are shown a welcome page which will allow them to upload their paper-bound curriculum and assignments.
- Teachers are then able to assign their uploaded documents to their students.
- Teachers are also able to view assignments which students have completed, and provide individual feedback.
- Students are able to view assignments and curriculum information via a separate application.
- Students are able to complete assignments, which they can then submit for review and feedback.
