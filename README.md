== App Background:

Schools are moving toward using iPads, and other technologies to provide students with paperless assignments. Teachers who already have set curriculums, often on paper / word docs, etc, need to have a way to scan his/her documents, in order to make assigments interactive and accessible for his/her students. 

Students can fill in form and submit. Fill in text areas/drawing areas.
